    <!--Jacob Eisenstein is a Research Scientist at Google AI. 
His work spans a range of topics in natural language processing, focusing on computational sociolinguistics, discourse, and machine learning. 
Prior to joining Google, he was Assistant and Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 
where he received the NSF CAREER Award 
and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Award. 
Prior to Georgia Tech, Jacob was a Postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon, 
where he initiated a line of research using latent variable machine learning 
methods to analyze social media data for insights in sociolinguistics and other areas of social science. 
He completed his Ph.D. at MIT in 2008, winning the George M. Sprowls dissertation award for his 
research on computational models of speech and gesture. 
Jacob's research has been featured in the New York Times, National Public Radio, and the BBC.
